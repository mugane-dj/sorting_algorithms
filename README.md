# Sorting Algorithms Implemented in C programming
The following repository contains code and concepts for various sorting algorithms implement in C programming. The sorting algorithms implemented include:
## Bubble sort
Bubble sort is an algorithm that compares adjacent elements of an array and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. Bubble sort has a time complexity of `O(n^2)`.
The `void bubble_sort(int *array, size_t size)` function depicts how to perform bubble sort on an array.

## Insertion sort
Insertion sort is an algorithm that sorts a given data set by inserting each element into its rightful position in the sorted order. Insertion sort also has a time complexity of `O(n^2)`. The `void insertion_sort_list(listint_t **list)` function depicts how to perform an insertion sort on a doubly linked list.

## Selection sort
Selection sort is an algorithm that sorts a given data set by repeatedly selecting the smallest element from the unsorted portion of the data set and adding it to the sorted portion. Selection sort also has a time complexity of `O(n^2)`. The `void selection_sort(int *array, size_t size)` function shows how to perform a selection sort on an array.

## Quick sort
Quick Sort is an efficient sorting algorithm that uses the divide and conquer approach to sort a given data set. Quick sort is considered the most efficient sorting algorithm as it has a time complexity of `O(n log n)` also known as log linear time complexity. The `void quick_sort(int *array, size_t size)` function show the implementation of quick sort.
